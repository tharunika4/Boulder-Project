                <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
                <img src="images/what-is-bouldering.jpg">
                <p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
